## 📝 Description
This project teaches:  
- System installation (Debian or Rocky Linux).  
- Partitioning with **LVM**.  
- User and group management.  
- Configuring **SSH**, and **UFW**.  
- Creating a monitoring script for system health.  

---

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Secure Debian installation.  
- ✅ Enforced password policy.  
- ✅ Sudo configuration with logs.  
- ✅ Firewall with **UFW**.  
- ✅ Intrusion prevention.  
- ✅ Cron-based monitoring script.

## ⚙️ Installation
Nothing to install – the virtual machine is not shared here.

---

## 🖥 Usage

In this repository you will find:
- various configuration files used by the needed tools,
- the monitoring script,
- a memo file containing most of the commands needed to configure the machine.

## 🔎 Examples

```bash
$ cat Born_to_be_root/config_files/common-password
#
# /etc/pam.d/common-password - password-related modules common to all services
#
# This file is included from other service-specific PAM config files,
# and should contain a list of modules that define the services to be
# used to change user passwords.  The default is pam_unix.

# Explanation of pam_unix options:
# The "yescrypt" option enables
#hashed passwords using the yescrypt algorithm, introduced in Debian
#11.  Without this option, the default is Unix crypt.  Prior releases
#used the option "sha512"; if a shadow password hash will be shared
#between Debian 11 and older releases replace "yescrypt" with "sha512"
#for compatibility .  The "obscure" option replaces the old
#`OBSCURE_CHECKS_ENAB' option in login.defs.  See the pam_unix manpage
#for other options.

# As of pam 1.0.1-6, this file is managed by pam-auth-update by default.
# To take advantage of this, it is recommended that you configure any
# local modules either before or after the default block, and use
# pam-auth-update to manage selection of other modules.  See
# pam-auth-update(8) for details.

# here are the per-package modules (the "Primary" block)
password	requisite			pam_pwquality.so retry=3
password	[success=1 default=ignore]	pam_unix.so obscure use_authtok try_first_pass yescrypt
# here's the fallback if no module succeeds
password	requisite			pam_deny.so
# prime the stack with a positive return value if there isn't one already;
# this avoids us returning an error just because nothing sets a success code
# since the modules above will each just jump around
password	required			pam_permit.so
# and here are more per-package modules (the "Additional" block)
# end of pam-auth-update config
```
